# rse-rss
The Resilient Spacecraft Executive implementation for the [Resilient Space Systems][rss] project (Caltech + NASA JPL + MIT + WHOI)

[rss]: http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/study/systems/Techupdate.html

Description
-----------

This repository will include ROS actionlib nodes and services, roslaunch scripts, and other material created as part of the Resilient Space Systems (RSS) project, an implementation of the RSS architecture called the Resilient Spacecraft Executive (RSE). These resources will mainly be Caltech-created and structural in nature.

The newest, fully ROS-native iteration of these resources is currently under development and to-be-released here under the BSD 3-clause license. Instructions for integrating algorithms into the codeset and modifying the layer policies will also be forthcoming.

(...Stay tuned! :)
